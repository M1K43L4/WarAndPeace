'''
REQUIREMENTS FOR: COUNTING THE OCCURRENCES OF EACH CHARACTER
* know what each character is (in the file) (MAY NOT BE NECESSARY)
* be able to return a count of each of those characters (REDUCE SHOULD DO THIS; it returns a single value)
** start by being able to return the count of a chosen character
# example: how many a's are in my file? REDUCE should return this
** now be able to return the count of ANY character
# example: how many 'INPUT_VALUE' are in my file?

'''

'''
REQUIREMENTS FOR: A FUNCTIONAL PARADIGM
* need to use map/reduce
* functional paradigms use CONSTANTS outside their scope; 
* PURE functional programs only depend on their input (no internal state)
